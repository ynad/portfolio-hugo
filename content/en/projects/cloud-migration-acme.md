## The Challenge

Acme Corp was running their infrastructure on physical servers in a local data center. As the business grew, maintenance costs and provisioning times had become unsustainable.

## The Solution

I designed and implemented a lift-and-shift migration strategy followed by a cloud-native optimization phase:

- **Assessment**: Analysis of 50+ services and their dependencies
- **Architecture**: AWS landing zone design with VPC, subnets, and security groups
- **IaC**: All infrastructure managed with Terraform
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines with GitHub Actions for each service
- **Monitoring**: Observability stack with CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana

## Results

- **Zero downtime** during migration
- **40% reduction** in infrastructure costs
- **Provisioning** from weeks to minutes
- **GDPR compliance** maintained throughout the process
